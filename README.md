# Core-Homelab-Services

Configuration of some Core services for my homelab

## Note

These are some default configurations for some of the software i use in my homelab-environment. \
All sensitive configuration like API-keys, Passwords, emails and even domains will for obvious reasons be left out. \
These appications are orchestrated with Docker Compose and serve as core-infrastructure upon which the rest of my homelab-environment will run on / use.
